# hubot-waiter

A hubot integration with Jenkins

See [`src/jenkins.js`](src/jenkins.js) for full documentation.

## Commands:
 * hubot jobs|list jobs [job name] - List the current jobs, filtering by the job name if needed
 * hubot build <branch> on <job name> - Builds branch on the environment specified by the job
 * hubot create alias <alias> for <job name> - Creates an alias for the job
 * hubot aliases|list aliases - Displays the list of aliases
 * hubot remove alias <alias name> - Removes an alias
 * hubot job status <job|alias name> - Displays the last status for the job.

## Installation

In hubot project repo, run:

`npm install hubot-waiter --save`

Then add **hubot-waiter** to your `external-scripts.json`:

```json
[
  "hubot-waiter"
]
```

## Configuration

hubot-waiter requires only the URL of the Jenkins instance and the token that is generated by slack. Respectively, HUBOT_JENKINS_URL and HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN.

You then need to configure the jobs to allow remote builds. In the job settings, check "Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)" and put the slack token in the Authentication Token field.
